and then the ML solution is just a classification problem of which of the 4 directions to go
training data can be generated from random instances solved with your optimal flow

I see, so the input is the problem, output is the next step each robot should take
(there's 5 directions robots can stay still)

yeah the problem on a local scale, like a 5x5 square around the robot
that would be the feature
plus current location & goal location or something like that
ive seen it work in fluid sim settings
